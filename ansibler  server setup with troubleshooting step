Project Setup and Troubleshooting Guide
1. Form Setup
If you're setting up a system to work with AWS servers and using Ansible to automate server management, follow the instructions below to set up the SSH Key and troubleshoot potential issues.

1.1. Setup Instructions
Step 1: Install Required Tools
Make sure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

AWS CLI: To interact with your AWS environment.

Ansible: To automate configurations and deployment.

SSH (OpenSSH): To connect securely to your EC2 instances.

You can install Ansible by running:

#bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
Step 2: Ensure SSH Key is Accessible
Before connecting to your EC2 instances, you need the SSH private key file (test1.pem) to access your servers.

Upload the Key to the Correct Location:

Place the SSH private key (test1.pem) in your local machine's Downloads folder or another accessible directory.

The correct path should look something like this: /home/your-user-name/Downloads/test1.pem

Set Permissions for SSH Key: Make sure that the private key has the correct permissions to be used for secure SSH access. Use the following command:

#bash

chmod 400 ~/Downloads/test1.pem
Step 3: Setup Inventory File for Ansible
Create an inventory file that tells Ansible where your servers are and how to connect to them. For example, create an inventory file at /etc/ansible/hosts.


[servers]
serverA ansible_host=<ServerA_Public_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/test1.pem
serverB ansible_host=<ServerB_Private_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/test1.pem
1.2. Connect to EC2 Instance Using SSH
To connect to a remote server, use the following command:

#bash

ssh -i ~/Downloads/test1.pem ubuntu@<ServerA_Public_IP>
Replace <ServerA_Public_IP> with the actual public IP address of the EC2 instance.

2. Troubleshooting Guide
2.1. scp Error: "No such file or directory"
Cause:
This error indicates that scp (secure copy) cannot find the file you're trying to transfer. This could be caused by:

Running the scp Command from the Wrong Machine:

Make sure to run scp from your local machine, not from the server.

Incorrect command (from the server):

#bash

ubuntu@172.31.88.189:~$ scp -i ~/Downloads/test1.pem ~/Downloads/test1.pem ubuntu@<ServerA_Public_IP>:/home/ubuntu/
Incorrect File Path:

The file path for the source or destination file could be incorrect. For example, if the file is located in the Downloads folder, ensure the path is correct.

Correct command:

#bash

scp -i ~/Downloads/test1.pem ~/Downloads/test1.pem ubuntu@<ServerA_Public_IP>:/home/ubuntu/
How to Resolve:
Step 1: Ensure the scp command is executed from your local machine, not inside any of the servers.

Step 2: Check that the path to the private key file (test1.pem) and the file you want to transfer are correct.

Example:

If the private key is in Downloads, use the path: ~/Downloads/test1.pem.

If your source file is in the Downloads folder, make sure it's correctly referenced: ~/Downloads/test1.pem.

2.2. Ansible Cannot Connect to Server - "Connection Timeout" or "Permission Denied"
Common Causes and Solutions:
Incorrect Inventory File Configuration: The inventory file tells Ansible where to find your servers. If itâ€™s misconfigured, Ansible won't be able to connect.

Example of Incorrect Inventory Configuration:


[servers]
serverA ansible_host=<ServerA_Public_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu
serverB ansible_host=<ServerB_Private_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu
Correct Inventory Configuration (Ensure correct private key path):


[servers]
serverA ansible_host=<ServerA_Public_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/test1.pem
serverB ansible_host=<ServerB_Private_IP> ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/test1.pem
Explanation:

ansible_host: The IP address of the server you want to manage.

ansible_user: The user you want to SSH with (usually ubuntu for AWS EC2).

ansible_ssh_private_key_file: The absolute path to your private key file.

Incorrect SSH Key Permissions:

If the private key file permissions are too open, SSH will reject it.

Set the correct permissions for the private key:

#bash
chmod 400 /home/ubuntu/test1.pem
Network Configuration Issues (Firewall / Security Group):

Ensure that the AWS Security Groups are properly configured to allow inbound SSH traffic on port 22.

Check the firewall settings to ensure there is no restriction on port 22.

How to Check Security Group in AWS:

In the AWS Console, go to EC2 > Security Groups and ensure that port 22 is open for inbound SSH connections.

How to Resolve:
Step 1: Verify the inventory file is correct and includes the correct IP addresses and private key paths.

Step 2: Make sure the private key file has read-only permissions (chmod 400).

Step 3: Check the AWS security group and ensure port 22 is open.

Step 4: Test SSH connectivity manually from your local machine to the server:

#bash

ssh -i /home/ubuntu/test1.pem ubuntu@<ServerB_Private_IP>
2.3. Additional Troubleshooting
Check Connection from the Control Node (Local Machine):

Ensure that you can SSH from your local machine to both servers (ServerA and ServerB). If you can't SSH manually, Ansible won't be able to either.

Ensure Network Routes Are Clear:

Check if both servers are reachable from each other by pinging their IP addresses. If there's a network issue, Ansible or SSH might not be able to connect.

3. Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to:

Properly configure your Ansible inventory file.

Ensure SSH keys are correctly placed and have the correct permissions.

Troubleshoot common scp and Ansible connection issues such as incorrect paths, network issues, and permission problems.
